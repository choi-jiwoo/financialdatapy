❗Python version above [3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) is required to use `financialdatapy`
.

```commandline

## Quick Start

`financialdatapy` supports three major financial statements of a company. Income statement, balance sheet, and cash
flow. Also the user can select between annual and quarter financial statements.

### API Key

❗When getting financial statements of a company listed in Korea stock exchange, API Key
from [DART](https://opendart.fss.or.kr/) should be provided in the system to successfully retrieve its data.

After receiving API key, store it on a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.

Inside `.env` file.

```
DART_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Initialization

```python
from financialdatapy.stock import Stock

# Apple
us_comp = Stock('aapl')
# Samsung Electronics
kor_comp = Stock('005930', country_code='kor')  # should specify 'country_code' for stock exchange other than US
```

Values passed for financial statements and periods should follow the format below. If no argument is passed, it
automatically retrieves income statement from annual report.

```python
income_statement = us_comp.financials('income_statement')
balance_sheet = us_comp.financials('balance_sheet')
cash_flow = us_comp.financials('cash_flow')

# Annual Report
income_statement = kor_comp.financials('income-statement', 'annual')
# Quarterly Report
income_statement = kor_comp.financials('income-statement', 'quarter')
```

### Financial Statement as reported

Financial statements reported by the company to a financial regulator. The elements in the financial statements are
different from others, depending on the comapany and stock exchange.

**United States Stock Exchange**

```python
us_comp = Stock('aapl')
ic_as_reported = us_comp.financials('income_statement', 'annual')
```

**Korea Stock Exchange**

```python
kor_comp = Stock('005930', country_code='kor')
ic_as_reported = kor_comp.financials('income_statement', 'annual')
```

To see the full financial report from a browser, pass `True` in `web`. Supports both US exchange and KOR exchange.

```python
us_comp.financials(web=True)
kor_comp.financials(web=True)
```

### Standard Financial Statement

us_comp = Stock('msft')
std_ic = us_comp.standard_financials('income_statement', 'annual')
```

```python
us_comp = Stock('aapl')
price = us_comp.price('2021-1-1', '2021-1-5')
